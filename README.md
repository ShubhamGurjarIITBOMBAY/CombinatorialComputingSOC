# CombinatorialComputingSOC
Repository for codes of the various problems given during the project

In the first week we looked at the various representation that we require for algorithms to run be it representing integers in different type of formats as well as 
representing the algorithms using graphs and tree with help of examples from chess moves.

In the second week main focus was to learn the backtracking problems which is slight advancement in the recursion technique along with it's  application in various 
problems like solving the maze or in N-Queens Problem ,Sudoku solver.

In the third week the main focus was to familiarise ourselves with sat solver, how to create the  logic conditions basically.
